There are a number of files that rely closely on the exact version of LLVM being used.  These
are included in the llvm-files directory.  To refresh these for a new version of LLVM, do

for i in *; do find $LLVMSRC -name $i -exec cp {} . ';'; done
for i in *; do find $LLVMBUILD -name $i -exec cp {} . ';'; done

The tblgen files need to be reconstructed as well, so run (it will take a while)

$LLVMBUILD/bin/llvm-tblgen -dump-json -I $LLVMSRC/include -I $LLVMSRC/lib/Target/X86 $LLVMSRC/lib/Target/X86/X86.td > /tmp/X86.json

and then

(cd hs && cabal v2-build && cabal v2-run exe:tblgen-json -- ../src/operand_table.inc /tmp/X86.json)

and then go get a cup of tea (takes about 4 min)
