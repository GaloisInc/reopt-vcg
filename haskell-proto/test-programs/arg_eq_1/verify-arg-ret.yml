# Verifying function call's arguments are equivalent,
# and the return values of `f which used the result
# from the callee are also equivalent.
# The targets are equivalent, hence expecting UNSAT.
# Note: This one does not work as expected for the moment,
#       as we need to state more about the relations/disjointness
#       for pointers on the stack (variable z in the program).
