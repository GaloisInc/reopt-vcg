This directory contains a simple example that has been compiled
with both Diet libc and glibc.

We use the extension .exe to denote executables, and have a Makefile
to build them.  Because the verifier is tightly depend on exact layout
choices made during compilation, we check in the executables even
though they can be build from LLVM 7.0.1.

The other examples will likely be integrated into this directory.
